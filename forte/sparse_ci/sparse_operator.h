/**
 * @brief The SparseOperator class
 * Base class for second quantized operators.
 *
 * An operator is a linear combination of terms, where each term is a numerical factor
 * times a product of second quantized operators (a SQOperator object)
 *
 * For example:
 *   0.1 * [2a+ 0a-] - 0.5 * [2a+ 0a-] + ...
 *       Term 0            Term 1
 *  
 *        This class stores operators in each term in the following canonical form
 *            a+_p1 a+_p2 ...  a+_P1 a+_P2 ...   ... a-_Q2 a-_Q1   ... a-_q2 a-_q1
 *            alpha creation   beta creation    beta annihilation  alpha annihilation
 * 
 *        with indices sorted as
 * 
 *            (p1 < p2 < ...) (P1 < P2 < ...)  (... > Q2 > Q1) (... > q2 > q1)
