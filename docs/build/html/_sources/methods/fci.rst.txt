Running the test cases
----------------------

Forte provides test cases for most of all methods implemented.
This is a good place to start if you are new to Forte.
After compiling and setting up ``PYTHONPATH``, you can run the test cases::

    cd tests/methods
    python run_forte_tests_travis.py
