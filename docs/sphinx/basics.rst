Test cases
----------

Forte provides test cases for most of all methods implemented.
This is a good place to start if you are new to Forte.
The test cases can be found in the ``<forte_dir>/tests/methods`` folder.

Jupyter Tutorials for Forte's Python API
----------------------------------------

Forte is designed as a C++ library with a lot of the classes and functionality
exposed in Python via the ``pybind11`` library.
Tutorials on how to use Forte's API can be found `here <https://github.com/evangelistalab/forte/tree/master/tutorials>`_.
