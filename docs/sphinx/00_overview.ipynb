    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Forte is an open-source suite of state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods applicable\n",
    "to chemical systems with strongly correlated electrons. The code is written as a plugin\n",
    "to Psi4 in C++ with C++17 functionality, and it takes advantage of shared memory parallelism throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Forte is composed of two types of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Active space methods\n",
    "  - Full/complete active space configuration interaction (FCI)/(CASCI)\n",
    "  - Adaptive configuration interaction (ACI)\n",
    "  - Projector configuration interaction (PCI)\n",
    "  - Complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)\n",
    "  - Density Matrix Renormalization Group self-consistent field (DMRG-SCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods for dynamical correlation\n",
    "  - Driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG)\n",
    "  - DSRG-MRPT2\n",
    "  - DSRG-MRPT3\n",
    "  - MR-LDSRG(2) \n",
    "  - Uncontracted multireference configuraiton interaction (MRCI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the active space methods, notably FCI, ACI, and PCI, can operate within the full\n",
    "orbital basis defined by the user-selected basis set. In this case, these methods also recover\n",
    "dynamical correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run Forte, the following are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Recent version of Psi4\n",
    "- CMake version 3.0 or higher\n",
    "- The tensor library Ambit"
