Specifying calculations of multiple states
==========================================

Requesting multiple solutions of a given spin and symmetry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Codes that support excited states take the additional option ``NROOT``,
which can be used to specify the number of solutions (roots) of the
charge, multiplicity, and symmetry specified by the user.

Assuming a :math:`C_{2v}` molecular point group, the following example is for
an input to compute three state of symmetry :math:`^{4}A_{2}` for a neutral
molecule::

    set forte {
      charge       0 # <-- neutral
      multiplicity 4 # <-- quartet
      root_sym     1 # <-- A_2
      nroot        3 # <-- three solutions
    }


Requesting multiple solutions of different spin and symmetry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For certain types of multistate computations (e.g., state-averaged CASSCF),
one may want to compute solutions of different spin and symmetry.

The simplest way to do so is by specifying the ``AVG_STATE`` option to
define different sets of electronic states.
This option is passed as a list of triplets of numbers
``[[irrep1, multi1, nstates1], [irrep2, multi2, nstates2], ...]``,
where ``irrep``, ``multi``, and ``nstates`` specify the irrep, multiplicity,
and the number of states of each type requested.

For example, for a molecule with :math:`C_{2v}` point group symmetry,
the following input requests four :math:`^{3}B_{1}` states and
two :math:`^{5}B_{2}` states::

    set forte {
      avg_state [[2,3,4],[3,5,2]] # <-- [(B1, triplet, 4 states), (B2,quintet,2 states)]
    } 

When ``AVG_STATE`` is specified, each state is assigned a weight, which 
by default is :math:`1/N` where :math:`N` is the total number of states
computed.
The weights of all the states can also be indicated with the ``AVG_WEIGHT``
option. This option is a list of lists of numbers that indicate the weight of
each state in a triplet defined via ``AVG_STATE``.
This option takes the format ``[[w1_1, w1_2, ..., w1_l],
" [w2_1, w2_2, ..., w2_m], ...]``, where each sublist specifies the weights of states
defined by a triplet ``[irrep, multi, nstates]``.

Suppose we want to do a computation on a singlet and two triplet :math:`A_{1}` states,
and assign a weight of 1/4 to the :math:`^1A_{1}` state and weights of 1/2 and 1/4 to the 
:math:`^3A_{1}` states. This computation can be specified by
the input::

  set forte {
    avg_state [[0,1,1],[0,3,2]]
    avg_weight [[0.25],[0.5,0.25]]
  } 

If the state weights do not add up to one, Forte will scale them, so the following input
is an equivalent way to perform the same computation::

  set forte {
    avg_state [[0,1,1],[0,3,2]]
    avg_weight [[1.],[2.,1.]]
  }  


Multistate GAS calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multistate computations using a GAS partitioning
(see :ref:`Occupation numbers of GAS wave functions`) can be used to generate
even more nuanced electronic states.
When the electronic states are specified via the ``AVG_STATE`` option,
one can indicate states with different GAS occupations by setting the
``GASNMIN`` and ``GASNMAX`` options. For multistate computations,
these are lists that specify the minimum and maximum occupation of each
GAS space for each triplet that defines an electronic state.

For example, the test case ``tests/methods/gasci-2`` shows how to compute
two electronic states of the water molecule of :math:`^1A_1` symmetry.
These two states use different occupation restrictions. Specifically,
the O 1s-like orbital (:math:`1a_1`) has maximum occupation of 2 and 1
in the two electronic states::

    set forte {
      gas1    [1,0,0,0]
      gas2    [3,0,1,2]
      gas1min [0,0]
      gas1max [2,1] # The second set of states is constrained to have at most 1 electron in GAS1
      avg_state [[0,1,1],[0,1,1]] # 2 states of singlet A_1 symmetry and different GAS
    }

While the first state is representative of the ground state of water,
the second state corresponds to a core-excited state.
