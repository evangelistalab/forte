    "# Specifying calculations of multiple states\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requesting multiple solutions of a given spin and symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Codes that support excited states take the additional option `NROOT`,\n",
    "which can be used to specify the number of solutions (roots) of the\n",
    "charge, multiplicity, and symmetry specified by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a $C_{2v}$ molecular point group, the following example is for\n",
    "an input to compute three state of symmetry $^{4}A_{2}$ for a neutral\n",
    "molecule:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    set forte {\n",
    "      charge       0 # <-- neutral\n",
    "      multiplicity 4 # <-- quartet\n",
    "      root_sym     1 # <-- A_2\n",
    "      nroot        3 # <-- three solutions\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requesting multiple solutions of different spin and symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain types of multistate computations (e.g., state-averaged CASSCF),\n",
    "one may want to compute solutions of different spin and symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to do so is by specifying the `AVG_STATE` option to\n",
    "define different sets of electronic states.\n",
    "This option is passed as a list of triplets of numbers\n",
    "`[[irrep1, multi1, nstates1], [irrep2, multi2, nstates2], ...]`,\n",
    "where `irrep`, `multi`, and `nstates` specify the irrep, multiplicity,\n",
    "and the number of states of each type requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a molecule with $C_{2v}$ point group symmetry,\n",
    "the following input requests four $^{3}B_{1}$ states and\n",
    "two $^{5}B_{2}$ states:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    set forte {\n",
    "      avg_state [[2,3,4],[3,5,2]] # <-- [(B1, triplet, 4 states), (B2,quintet,2 states)]\n",
    "    } \n",
    "```\n",
    "When `AVG_STATE` is specified, each state is assigned a weight, which \n",
    "by default is $1/N$ where $N$ is the total number of states\n",
    "computed.\n",
    "The weights of all the states can also be indicated with the `AVG_WEIGHT`\n",
    "option. This option is a list of lists of numbers that indicate the weight of\n",
    "each state in a triplet defined via `AVG_STATE`.\n",
    "This option takes the format `[[w1_1, w1_2, ..., w1_l],\n",
    "\" [w2_1, w2_2, ..., w2_m], ...]`, where each sublist specifies the weights of states\n",
    "defined by a triplet `[irrep, multi, nstates]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to do a computation on a singlet and two triplet $A_{1}$ states,\n",
    "and assign a weight of 1/4 to the $^1A_{1}$ state and weights of 1/2 and 1/4 to the \n",
    "$^3A_{1}$ states. This computation can be specified by\n",
    "the input:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  set forte {\n",
    "    avg_state [[0,1,1],[0,3,2]]\n",
    "    avg_weight [[0.25],[0.5,0.25]]\n",
    "  } \n",
    "```\n",
    "If the state weights do not add up to one, Forte will scale them, so the following input\n",
    "is an equivalent way to perform the same computation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  set forte {\n",
    "    avg_state [[0,1,1],[0,3,2]]\n",
    "    avg_weight [[1.],[2.,1.]]\n",
    "  }  \n",

    "## Multistate GAS calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Multistate computations using a GAS partitioning\n",
    "(see :ref:`Occupation numbers of GAS wave functions`) can be used to generate\n",
    "even more nuanced electronic states.\n",
    "When the electronic states are specified via the `AVG_STATE` option,\n",
    "one can indicate states with different GAS occupations by setting the\n",
    "`GASNMIN` and `GASNMAX` options. For multistate computations,\n",
    "these are lists that specify the minimum and maximum occupation of each\n",
    "GAS space for each triplet that defines an electronic state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the test case `tests/methods/gasci-2` shows how to compute\n",
    "two electronic states of the water molecule of $^1A_1$ symmetry.\n",
    "These two states use different occupation restrictions. Specifically,\n",
    "the O 1s-like orbital ($1a_1$) has maximum occupation of 2 and 1\n",
    "in the two electronic states:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    set forte {\n",
    "      gas1    [1,0,0,0]\n",
    "      gas2    [3,0,1,2]\n",
    "      gas1min [0,0]\n",
    "      gas1max [2,1] # The second set of states is constrained to have at most 1 electron in GAS1\n",
    "      avg_state [[0,1,1],[0,1,1]] # 2 states of singlet A_1 symmetry and different GAS\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "While the first state is representative of the ground state of water,\n",
    "the second state corresponds to a core-excited state."
