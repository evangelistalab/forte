Compiling and running Forte
===========================

Download and compilation of Forte
---------------------------------

Prior to the compilation of Forte you must first check to make sure you
have the following:

1. CMake version 3.0 or higher

2. An updated version of Psi4 (obtain it from
   https://github.com/psi4/psi4)

3. The tensor library Ambit (obtain it from
   https://github.com/jturney/ambit). Note that ambit is included in the
   conda distribution of psi4. So if you already have the latest version
   of psi4 installed there is no need to compile ambit.

Once you have the current versions of Psi4, CMake, and Ambit, follow the
following instructions to install Forte.

Download Forte
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to the
   location where you want to clone the Forte directory. Let’s assume
   this is the folder ``src``.

2. Clone Forte from GitHub by pasting the following command:

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:evangelistalab/forte.git

The repository will be cloned in the folder ``src/forte``

1. Compilation via ``setup.py`` (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most convenient way to compile forte is using the ``setup.py``
script. To compile Forte do the following:

1. From the ``src`` directory change to the forte directory
   ``src/forte``
2. Tell ``setup.py`` where to find ambit, which can be done by creating
   the ``src/forte/setup.cfg`` file and adding the following lines

.. code:: tcsh

   [CMakeBuild]
   ambitpath=<ambit install dir>

or alternatively by setting the environmental variable ``AMBITDIR`` to
point to the ambit install directory (note: there is no need to append
``share/cmake/ambit``)

.. code:: tcsh

   export AMBITPATH=<ambit install dir>

3. Compile forte by calling

.. code:: tcsh

   python setup.py develop 

or for Debug mode

.. code:: tcsh

   python setup.py build_ext --debug develop

This procedure will register forte within pip and you should be able to
see forte listed just by calling

.. code:: tcsh

   pip list

You can test that the path to Forte is set correctly by running python
and importing forte:

.. code:: python

   import forte

2. Compilation via CMake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forte may also be compiled by directly invoking CMake by following these
instructions:

1. Run psi4 in the Forte folder

::

   psi4 --plugin-compile

Psi4 will generate a CMake command for building Forte that looks like:
``cmake -C /usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4/share/cmake/psi4/psi4PluginCache.cmake         -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4 .``

2. Run the cmake command generated in 1. appending the location of
   Ambit’s cmake files (via the ``-Dambit_DIR option``):

::

    cmake -C /usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4/share/cmake/psi4/psi4PluginCache.cmake
          -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4 .
          -Dambit_DIR=<ambit-bin-dir>/share/cmake/ambit

3. Run make

.. code:: tcsh

    make

Setting up the ``PYTHONPATH``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If Forte is compiled with CMake, you will need to specify ``PYTHONPATH``
environment variable to make sure that it can be imported in python.
Assuming that you cloned Forte from the folder ``src`` then you will
have a folder named ``src/forte``. Your ``PYTHONPATH`` should then
include ``src/forte``

.. code:: bash

   # in bash
   export PYTHONPATH=<homedir>/src/forte:$PYTHONPATH 

This allows Forte to be imported correctly since the main
``__init__.py`` file for Forte is found at
``src/forte/forte/__init__.py``

CMake script
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following script automates the Forte compilation process

::

   #! /bin/tcsh

   # Modify the following four parameters
   set ambit_dir = /Users/fevange/Bin/ambit-Release/share/cmake/ambit/ # <- location of ambit
   set srcdir = /Users/fevange/Source/forte   # <- location of forte source
   set build_type = Release # <- Release, Release, or RelWithDebInfo

   # Run cmake
   cd $srcdir

   set cmake_psi4 = `psi4 --plugin-compile`

   $cmake_psi4 \
   -Dambit_DIR=$ambit_dir \ # remove this line if ambit is installed via conda
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$build_type \
   -DMAX_DET_ORB=128 \
   -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/anaconda3/bin/python \
   -DENABLE_ForteTests=TRUE \

   make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`

Advanced compilation options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Number of threads used to compile Forte**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To speed up compilation of Forte specify the number of threads to use
for compilation. This can be done in the ``setup.cfg`` file via

.. code:: tcsh

   [CMakeBuild]
   nprocs=<number of threads>

or when using CMake, compile Forte with the option -jn, for example, to
compile with four threads

.. code:: tcsh

   make -j4

Add configuration and build options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using ``setup.py`` you can specify the ``CMAKE_CONFIG_OPTIONS`` and
``CMAKE_BUILD_OPTIONS`` passed internally to CMake in ``setup.cfg``

.. code:: tcsh

   [CMakeBuild]
   cmake_config_options=...
   cmake_build_options=...

These are convenient if you want to specify a different compiler from
the one automatically detected by CMake.

**Maximum number of orbitals in the ``Determinant`` class**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Forte is compiled assuming that the maximum number of
orbitals that can be handled by codes that use the ``Determinant`` class
is 64. To change this value modify the ``setup.cfg`` file to include

.. code:: tcsh

   [CMakeBuild]
   max_det_orb=<a multiple of 64>

or add the option

.. code:: tcsh

   -DMAX_DET_ORB=<a multiple of 64>

if compiling with CMake.

**Enabling code coverage**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable compilation with code coverage activated, set the option
``enable_codecov`` to ``ON`` in the ``setup.cfg`` file
``tcsh   [CMakeBuild]   enable_codecov=ON`` or add the option
``tcsh   -DENABLE_CODECOV=ON`` if compiling with CMake.

Compilation via ``setup.py`` (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most convenient way to compile forte is using the ``setup.py``
script. To compile Forte do the following:

1. Tell ``setup.py`` where to find ambit, which can be done either by
   setting the environmental variable ``AMBITDIR`` to point to the ambit
   install directory (note: there is no need to append
   ``share/cmake/ambit``)

.. code:: bash

   export AMBITPATH=<ambit install dir>

or by modifying the ``<fortedir>/setup.cfg`` file to include

.. code:: bash

   [CMakeBuild]
   ambitpath=<ambit install dir>

2. Compile forte by calling in ``<fortedir>``

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py develop 

or for Debug mode

.. code:: bash

   fortedir> python setup.py build_ext --debug develop

This procedure will register forte within pip and you should be able to
see forte listed just by calling

.. code:: bash

   pip list

Compilation via CMake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forte may also be compiled by directly invoking CMake by following these
instructions:

1. Run psi4 in the Forte folder

::

   psi4 --plugin-compile

Psi4 will generate a CMake command for building Forte that looks like:
``cmake -C /usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4/share/cmake/psi4/psi4PluginCache.cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4 .``

2. Run the cmake command generated in 1. appending the location of
   Ambit’s cmake files (via the ``-Dambit_DIR option``):

::

    cmake -C /usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4/share/cmake/psi4/psi4PluginCache.cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4 . -Dambit_DIR=<ambit-bin-dir>/share/cmake/ambit

3. Run make

::

    make

The following script automates steps 1 and 2 of the forte compilation
process

::

   #! /bin/tcsh

   # Modify the following four parameters
   set ambit_dir = /Users/fevange/Bin/ambit-Release/share/cmake/ambit/ # <- location of ambit
   set srcdir = /Users/fevange/Source/forte   # <- location of forte source
   set build_type = Release # <- Release, Release, or RelWithDebInfo

   # Run cmake
   cd $srcdir

   set cmake_psi4 = `psi4 --plugin-compile`

   $cmake_psi4 \
   -Dambit_DIR=$ambit_dir \ # remove this line if ambit is installed via conda
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$build_type \
   -DMAX_DET_ORB=128 \
   -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/anaconda3/bin/python \
   -DENABLE_ForteTests=TRUE \

Advanced compilation options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Maximum number of orbitals in the** ``Determinant`` **class**. By
   default, Forte is compiled assuming that the maximum number of
   orbitals that can be handled by codes that use the ``Determinant``
   class is 64. To change this value modify the ``<fortedir>/setup.cfg``
   file to include

.. code:: bash

   [CMakeBuild]
   max_det_orb=<a multiple of 64>

or add the option

::

   -DMAX_DET_ORB=<a multiple of 64>

if compiling with CMake.

-  **Enabling code coverage**. To enable compilation with code coverage
   activated, set the option ``enable_codecov`` to ``ON`` in the
   ``<fortedir>/setup.cfg`` file

.. code:: bash

   [CMakeBuild]
   enable_codecov=ON

or add the option

.. code:: bash

   -DENABLE_CODECOV=ON

if compiling with CMake.
