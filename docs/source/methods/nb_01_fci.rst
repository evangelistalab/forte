FCI: Full Configuration Interaction
===================================

Theory
------

Forte contains a determinant-based implementation of the Full
Configuration Interaction (FCI) method. The FCI method belongs to the
category of active space solvers and can be used on its own or to
produce reference states for subsequent multireference treatments of
dynamical electron correlation. In FCI, the user specifies a set of
active orbitals and all Slater determinants :math:`\Phi_I` with the
correct symmetry and value of :math:`M_S` are generated. The FCI wave
function :math:`\Psi` is a linear combination of the determinants

.. math::


   |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{I}^{N_\mathrm{FCI}} C_I |\Phi_I\rangle

where :math:`N_\mathrm{FCI}` is the number of determinants in the FCI
space and :math:`C_I` are the expansion coefficients.

The FCI wave function is variationally optimized by solving the
eigenvalue problem

.. math::


   \hat{H} |\Psi\rangle = E_\mathrm{FCI} |\Psi\rangle

where :math:`\hat{H}` is the Hamiltonian operator.

In Forte, the FCI wave function is always assumed to be normalized, that
is, the coefficients :math:`C_I` are normalized such that

.. math::


   \sum_{I}^{N_\mathrm{FCI}} |C_I|^2 = 1

The FCI energy is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
operator :math:`\hat{H}` with respect to the FCI wave function

.. math::


   E_\mathrm{FCI} = \langle \Psi | \hat{H} | \Psi \rangle

Implementation details
----------------------

To solve the FCI equations, Forte’s implementation uses the Davidson–Liu
solver, which requires computing only the action of the Hamiltonian onto
a general FCI vector :math:`\sum_I b_I |\Phi_I\rangle`:

.. math::


   \hat{H} \sum_I b_I |\Phi_I\rangle = \sum_I \sigma_I |\Phi_I\rangle

In this case, the final state can be written in terms of the coefficient
vector :math:`\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{b}`, where here
we use matrix/vector notation.

The algorithm that computes
:math:`\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{b}` is called the
**sigma algorithm**. Forte implements the string-based sigma algorithm
Bendazzoli and Evangelisti [Bendazzoli, G. L.; Evangelisti, S. *J Chem
Phys* **98**, 3141 (1993)].

In Forte’s string-based implementation, the FCI wave function is
expressed in terms of separate occupation strings for the alpha
(:math:`I_\alpha`) and beta (:math:`I_\beta`) electrons, so that a state
can be written as

.. math::


   |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{I_\mathrm{\alpha}}^{N_\alpha} \sum_{I_\mathrm{\beta}}^{N_\beta} C_{I_\alpha I_\beta} |\Phi_{I_\alpha I_\beta}\rangle
   = \sum_{I_\mathrm{\alpha}}^{N_\alpha} \sum_{I_\mathrm{\beta}}^{N_\beta} C_{I_\alpha I_\beta} |I_\alpha \rangle \otimes |I_\beta \rangle

This means that internally, the FCI vector :math:`C_I` is stored as a
matrix indexed by the strings :math:`I_\alpha` and :math:`I_\beta`:
:math:`C_{[I_\alpha][I_\beta]}`.

A Few Practical Notes
---------------------

-  FCI computations in Forte run only in the active orbitals (defined by
   the ``ACTIVE`` keyword). See more information in the Tutorials to
   learn how to define the target active space.
-  The default procedure in Forte solves the FCI eigenvalue equation in
   the Slater determinant basis. In this case Forte projects out
   contaminants of the wrong spin symmetry; however, this procedure can
   fail to yield a state with correct multiplicity. To guarantee that
   the final state is an eigenfunction of :math:`\hat{S}^2`, turn on
   spin adapation by setting the option ``CI_SPIN_ADAPT`` to ``True``.
-  Difficult cases of convergence can be resolved with a combination of
   using a spin-adapted FCI algorithm and by modifying the parameters of
   the Davidson–Liu solver used by the FCI code.

A First Example
---------------

The following is an example of a FCI computation on the Li2 molecule
using the cc-pVDZ basis.

.. code:: python

   # forte/tests/manual/fci-1/input.dat

   import forte

   molecule li2 {
   0 1
   Li
   Li 1 1.6
   }

   set {
       basis cc-pVDZ
       reference rhf
   }

   set forte {
       active_space_solver fci
   }

   # run a RHF computation
   E_scf, scf_wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True)

   # pass the RHF orbitals to Forte and run a FCI computation
   energy('forte', ref_wfn=scf_wfn)

The output of this computation contains useful information about the
number of determinants, symmetry, multiplicity of the root
(:math:`2S + 1`), number of roots required, etc.

By default, to guess an intial solution, the FCI code identifies a small
list of low-energy determinant that are spin complete and diagonalizes
the Hamiltonian and :math:`\hat{S}^2` operators. This procedure yields a
list of root with their corresponding energy and expectation value of
:math:`\hat{S}^2`. The roots projected out are listed at the bottom.

           ...

Initial guess and parameters of the Davidson-Liu algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------

The Davidson-Liu procedure requires an initial set of guess vectors. In
Forte, the initial guesses are determined by diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian in a small space of determinants
:math:`\{ |\Phi'_I\rangle \}`. This space is spin complete. The
procedure starts with the diagonalization of the matrix representation
of the :math:`\hat{S}^2` operator

.. math::


   (\mathbf{S}^2)_{IJ} = \langle \Phi'_I | \hat{S}^2 |\Phi'_J\rangle

which allows to group the solution according to the multiplicity. After
this step, we transform the Hamiltonian to the basis of eigenstates of
:math:`\hat{S}^2` and diagonalize each block separately. The guess
vectors are taken from the lowest energy solutions with the correct
multiplicity. If a guess vector with wrong multiplicity happens to fall
below the energy of guess vector with the correct multiplicity, we
project the incorrect guess during the diagonalization procedure.

The number of guess vectors and the size of the determinant space used
to generate the initial guess is determined by options controlled by the
user. Once the user specifies the number of target states (roots) and
the multiplicity, then the option ``DL_GUESS_PER_ROOT`` (default = 1)
controls the number of guess states requested, that is:

Number of guess states = Number of roots :math:`\times`
``DL_GUESS_PER_ROOT``

The subspace of determinants selected for the initial guess has size
controlled by the option ``DL_DETS_PER_GUESS`` (default = 50) , which
determines the number of determinants included in the following way

Number of determinants used to build guesses = Number of guess states
:math:`\times` ``DL_DETS_PER_GUESS``

Note that the number of determinants used in the initial guess procedure
could be larger than the one determined by the equation above. This
happens if the determinants selected do not form a spin-complete set. In
this case, additional determinants are added to ensure that the
determinant space is spin-complete.

Two other options control the Davidson-Liu procedure: -
``DL_SUBSPACE_PER_ROOT``: this option controls the maximum number of
subspace vectors stored by the DL algorithm:

::

   Maximum number of subspace vectors =  Number of roots $\times$ `DL_SUBSPACE_PER_ROOT`

-  ``DL_COLLAPSE_PER_ROOT``: once the maximum number of subspace vectors
   is reached, the DL procedure forms the best solution vectors and
   collapses (resets) the subspace size. This option controls the number
   of vectors kept after collapes:

   Number of subspace vectors after collapse = Number of roots
   :math:`\times` ``DL_COLLAPSE_PER_ROOT``

**When should you modify these options?** ``DL_GUESS_PER_ROOT`` and
``DL_DETS_PER_GUESS`` should be modified **if the DL procedure has
trouble finding the correct initial guess**. For example, if the
determinant space is too small, the initial guess procedure may produce
a list of states with incorrect energetic ordering. See the test case
``forte/tests/methods/detci-5`` for an example.

``DL_COLLAPSE_PER_ROOT`` and ``DL_SUBSPACE_PER_ROOT`` should be modified
**if the DL procedure has trouble converging**.

Note that these options need to be changed carefully. If you ask for
more guess vectors than those available in a given space the code will
fail. Additionally, ``DL_COLLAPSE_PER_ROOT`` should be greater or equal
to ``DL_GUESS_PER_ROOT``, and ``DL_SUBSPACE_PER_ROOT`` should be greater
than ``DL_COLLAPSE_PER_ROOT``.

Spin-adapted FCI
----------------

In certain cases, convergence to a state with target multiplicity fails
due to either variational collapse to a root of lower energy and
different multiplicity or because no guess state can be found. Spin
adaptation can be turned on by setting the option ``CI_SPIN_ADAPT`` to
``True``.

Forte implements within the determinant-based FCI code a procedure to
perform the Davidson–Liu procedure in a basis of configuration state
funcions (CSFs). CSFs are spin-adapted linear combinations of Slater
determinants with a given orbital occupation pattern (electron
configuration).

When expressed in the CSF basis a FCI state is given by:

.. math::


   |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{i} C'_{i} | \mathrm{CSF}_i \rangle

where the coefficients :math:`C'_{i}` are **different** from the ones
that express :math:`\Psi` in the Slater determinant basis. Forte’s
spin-adapted code computes the sigma vector in the determinant basis
and, before feeding it to the Davidson–Liu solver, it converts it to the
CSF basis. Spin-adapted FCI computation are more expensive than
conventional ones, with the additional cost of the order of 10–15%.

To demonstrate the utility of spin adaptation, consider a computation of
the :math:`A_1` quintet state of Li2. In a determinant code, a
straightforward modification of the previous example (``fci-1``) fails
because the algorithm that guesses the initial state cannot find a
quintet state.

In the following input we set ``ci_spin_adapt`` to ``True`` and specify
the multiplicity of the state (``5``).

.. code:: python

   # forte/tests/manual/fci-2/input.dat

   import forte

   molecule li2 {
   0 1
   Li
   Li 1 2.0
   }

   set {
       basis cc-pVDZ
       reference rhf
       e_convergence 9
   }

   set forte {
       active_space_solver fci
       ci_spin_adapt true
       multiplicity 5
   }

   # run a RHF computation
   E_scf, scf_wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True)

   # pass the RHF orbitals to Forte and run a FCI computation
   energy('forte', ref_wfn=scf_wfn)

The output file contains some extra/different sections. At the beginning
of the computation we can read information about the number of CSF and
CSF construction timing:

       Timing for finding the CSFs:               0.3369

**Since in this example the orbitals come from a RHF computation** (same
number of alpha and beta electrons) Forte will assume that the target
state havs :math:`M_S = 0`. This can be seen from the determinant
composition and in the final energy summary that reports the value of
:math:`2 M_S` (``2ms``)
