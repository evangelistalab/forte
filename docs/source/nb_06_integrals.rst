Selecting two-electron integral types
=====================================

Forte can handle different types of exact and approximate two-electron
integrals. This section describes the various options available and
their properties/limitations. The selection of different integral types
is controlled by the option ``INT_TYPE``

Conventional integrals
----------------------

Conventional integrals are the default choice for Forte. When this
option is selected, Forte will compute and store the two-electron
integrals in the molecular orbital (MO) basis :math:`\phi_p`.
:raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
\langle pq | rs \rangle = \int dx_1 dx_2 \phi_p^*(x_1) \phi_q^*(x_2) r_{12}^{-1} \phi_r(x_1) \phi_s(x_2)
\end{equation}`

These integrals are computed with Psi4’s ``IntegralTrasform`` class and
written to disk. Forte will store three copies of these integrals, the
antisymmetrized alpha-alpha and beta-beta integrals
:raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
\langle p_\alpha q_\alpha \| r_\alpha s_\alpha \rangle,  \langle p_\beta q_\beta \| r_\beta s_\beta \rangle,
\end{equation}` and the alpha-beta integrals (not antisymmetrized)
:raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
\langle p_\alpha q_\beta | r_\alpha s_\beta \rangle,
\end{equation}` for all values of :math:`p, q, r, s`. Storage of these
integrals has a memory cost equal to :math:`3 N^4`, where :math:`N` is
the number of orbitals that are correlated (frozen core and virtual
orbitals excluded). Therefore, conventional integrals are viable for
computations with at most 100-200 orbitals. For larger bases, density
Fitting and Cholesky decomposition are instead recommended.

Density Fitting (DF) and Cholesky Decomposition (CD)
----------------------------------------------------

The density fitting and Cholesky decomposition methods approximate
two-electron integrals as products of three-index tensors
:math:`b_{pr}^{P}` :raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
\langle pq | rs \rangle = \sum_P^M b_{pr}^{P} b_{qs}^{P}
\end{equation}`

where :math:`M` is a quantity of the order :math:`3 N`.

**Note**: The equations reported here use physicist notation for the
two-electron integrals, but the DF/CD literature usually adopts
chemist’s notation. The main difference between DF and CD is in the way
the B tensors are defined. In DF, the :math:`b` tensor is defined as
:raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
b_{pq}^{Q} = \sum_p (pq | P)[(P | Q)^{-1/2}]_{PQ}
\end{equation}`

where the indices :math:`P` and :math:`Q` refer to the auxiliary basis
set.

**Two options control the type of density fitting basis used in forte**.
The auxiliary basis used in the correlated computations is defined via
the Psi4 option ``DF_BASIS_MP2``. The auxiliary basis used in CASSCF is
defined via the Psi4 option ``DF_BASIS_SCF``. These two options can be
different, but this might lead to an unconsistent treatment of
correlation effects.

In the CD approach, the :math:`b` tensor is formed via Cholesky
decomposition of the exact two-electron integrals in the atomic basis.
The accuracy of this decomposition (and the resulting two-electron
integrals) is determined by a user defined tolerance selected via the
option ``CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE``. Both the DF and CD algorithms store the
:math:`b` tensor in memory, and therefore, they require
:math:`M N^2 \approx 3 N^3` memory for storage. On a single node with
128 GB of memory, DF and CD computations allow to treat up to 1000
orbitals.

Disk-based Density Fitting (DiskDF)
-----------------------------------

Calculations with more than 1000 basis functions quickly become
unfeasible as the memory requirements of density fitting grows as the
cube of basis size. In this case, it is possible to switch to a
disk-based implementation of DF, which assumes that the :math:`b` tensor
can be fully stored on disk.

Integrals from a FCIDUMP file
-----------------------------

Most of Forte computations can also be executed using integrals read
from a FCIDUMP file. To read integrals in the FCIDUMP format just use
the option ``INT_TYPE = FCIDUMP``. For example:

::

       import forte
       set forte {
         active_space_solver fci
         int_type            fcidump
         frozen_docc         [2 ,0 ,0 ,0]
         restricted_docc     [2 ,0 ,0 ,0]
         active              [2 ,2 ,2 ,2]
       }

The default name of the FCIDUMP file is ``INTDUMP``, but it can be
changed via the option ``FCIDUMP_FILE``. Forte will read the number of
orbital, number of electrons, the multiplicity, and irrep from the
FCIDUMP file. This information is then used to build a ``StateInfo``
object that contains all information regarding the electronic state that
will be computed. The user can, however, select a different state by
specifying the number of electrons (``NEL``), multiplicity
(``MULTIPLICITY``), and irrep (``ROOT_SYM``) via the appropriate
options.

Integral Selection Keywords
---------------------------

The following keywords control the integral class and affect all
computations that run in Forte:

-  **INT_TYPE** ``INT_TYPE`` selects the integral type used in the
   calculation

   -  Type: string
   -  Default: ``CONVENTIONAL``
   -  Possible Values: ``CONVENTIONAL``, ``DF``, ``CHOLESKY``,
      ``DISKDF``, ``FCIDUMP``

-  **CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE** The tolerance for the cholesky decomposition.
   This keyword determines the accuracy of the computation. A smaller
   tolerance is a more accurate computation. The tolerance for the
   cholesky decomposition:

   -  Type: double in scientific notation (ie 1e-5 or 0.0001)
   -  Default: ``1.0e-6``

-  **DF_BASIS_MP2** The basis set used for density fitting the integrals
   used in all correlated computations. This keyword needs to be placed
   in the globals section of a Psi4 input. This basis should be one of
   the RI basis sets designed for a given primary basis, for example,
   when using ``BASIS = cc-pVDZ`` you should use
   ``DF_BASIS_MP2 = cc-pVDZ-RI``.

   -  Type: string specifing basis set
   -  Default: none

-  **DF_BASIS_SCF** The basis set used for density fitting the integrals
   used in forte’s CASSCF computations. This keyword needs to be placed
   in the globals section of a Psi4 input. This basis should be one of
   the JK basis sets designed for a given primary basis, for example,
   when using ``BASIS = cc-pVDZ`` you should use
   ``DF_BASIS_SCF = cc-pVDZ-JKfit``.

   -  Type: string specifing basis set
   -  Default: none

-  **FCIDUMP_FILE** ``FCIDUMP_FILE`` selects the file from which to read
   the integrals in the FCIDUMP format

   -  Type: string
   -  Default: ``INTDUMP``
