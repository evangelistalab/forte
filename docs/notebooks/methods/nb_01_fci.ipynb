    "## A Few Practical Notes\n",
    "- FCI computations in Forte run only in the active orbitals (defined by the `ACTIVE` keyword). See more information in the Tutorials to learn how to define the target active space.\n",
    "- The default procedure in Forte solves the FCI eigenvalue equation in the Slater determinant basis. In this case Forte projects out contaminants of the wrong spin symmetry; however, this procedure can fail to yield a state with correct multiplicity. To guarantee that the final state is an eigenfunction of $\\hat{S}^2$, turn on spin adapation by setting the option `CI_SPIN_ADAPT` to `True`.\n",
    "- Difficult cases of convergence can be resolved with a combination of using a spin-adapted FCI algorithm and by modifying the parameters of the Davidson–Liu solver used by the FCI code."
