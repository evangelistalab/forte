    "## The standard workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to run Forte computations is through the standard workflow.\n",
    "This requires the user to write an input file or a python script that is then executed by calling Psi4 on the command line or via Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps in the standard workflow are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Forte's standard workflow scheme](../source/images/standard_workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in the standard workflow based on a Psi4 input file are as follow:\n",
    "1. The computation starts from an input file in the Psithon format.\n",
    "1. Options for performing a computation are read from the file and passed to Forte\n",
    "1. Orbitals and integrals are generated in Psi4 (after running a SCF computation) or read from a file.\n",
    "1. Optionally, the orbitals are localized or AVAS orbitals are formed\n",
    "1. An active space solver computation is performed on the system (e.g. CASCI)\n",
    "1. An MCSCF computation is performed using the active space solver used in step e)\n",
    "1. Optionally, the orbitals are transformed to enable an embedding computation\n",
    "1. A dynamical correlation solver computation is performed (e.g., MR-DSRG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This standard workflow encompasses a variety of user case scenarios, allowing any combination of integrals, active space solvers, and dynamical correlation solvers.\n",
    "This is possible due to Forte's extensive use of abstract interfaces and polymorphism, which enables using a single workflow code that is easy to maintain."
