    "## Installing Forte from conda\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get Forte is by downloading [compiled binaries](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/forte/files) from conda. These are currently available for x86 Mac and Linux. The recommended way to do so is by creating a new `forte` environment\n",

    "```bash\n",
    ">conda create -n forte forte -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "import forte\n",

    "## Compiling Forte\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the compilation of Forte you must first check to make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CMake version 3.0 or higher\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An updated version of Psi4 (obtain it from https://github.com/psi4/psi4)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The tensor library Ambit (obtain it from https://github.com/jturney/ambit). Note that ambit is included in the conda distribution of psi4. So if you already have the latest version of psi4 installed there is no need to compile ambit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the current versions of Psi4, CMake, and Ambit, follow the following instructions to install Forte.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Forte\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the Forte directory.\n",
    "Let's assume this is the folder `src`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone Forte from GitHub by pasting the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:evangelistalab/forte.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "The repository will be cloned in the folder `src/forte`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Compilation via `setup.py` (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most convenient way to compile forte is using the `setup.py` script. To compile Forte do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the `src` directory change to the forte directory `src/forte`\n",
    "1. Tell `setup.py` where to find ambit, which can be done by creating the `src/forte/setup.cfg` file and adding the following lines\n",
    "```tcsh\n",
    "[CMakeBuild]\n",
    "ambitpath=<ambit install dir>\n",
    "```\n",
    "or alternatively by setting the environmental variable `AMBITDIR` to point to the ambit install directory (note: there is no need to append `share/cmake/ambit`)\n",
    "```tcsh\n",
    "export AMBITPATH=<ambit install dir>\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Compile forte by calling\n",
    "```tcsh\n",
    "python setup.py develop \n",
    "```\n",
    "or for Debug mode\n",
    "```tcsh\n",
    "python setup.py build_ext --debug develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "This procedure will register forte within pip and you should be able to see forte listed just by calling\n",
    "```tcsh\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can test that the path to Forte is set correctly by running python and importing forte:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import forte\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Compilation via CMake\n",
    "\n",
    "Forte may also be compiled by directly invoking CMake by following these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run psi4 in the Forte folder\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  psi4 --plugin-compile\n",
    "  ```\n",
    " Psi4 will generate a CMake command for building Forte that looks like:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  cmake -C /usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4/share/cmake/psi4/psi4PluginCache.cmake\n",
    "        -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4 .\n",
    "  ```\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Run the cmake command generated in 1. appending the location of Ambit's cmake files (via the `-Dambit_DIR option`):\n",
    " ```\n",
    "  cmake -C /usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4/share/cmake/psi4/psi4PluginCache.cmake\n",
    "        -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/psi4/stage/usr/local/psi4 .\n",
    "        -Dambit_DIR=<ambit-bin-dir>/share/cmake/ambit\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Run make\n",
    " ```tcsh\n",
    "  make\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up the `PYTHONPATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "If Forte is compiled with CMake, you will need to specify `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to make sure that it can be imported in python. Assuming that you cloned Forte from the folder `src` then you will have a folder named `src/forte`.\n",
    "Your `PYTHONPATH` should then include `src/forte`\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# in bash\n",
    "export PYTHONPATH=<homedir>/src/forte:$PYTHONPATH \n",
    "```\n",

    "To speed up compilation of Forte specify the number of threads to use for compilation.\n",

    "```tcsh\n",
    "[CMakeBuild]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add configuration and build options\n",

    "#### **Maximum number of orbitals in the `Determinant` class**\n",
    "By default, Forte is compiled assuming that the maximum number of orbitals that can be handled by codes that use the `Determinant` class is 64. To change this value modify the `setup.cfg` file to include\n",
