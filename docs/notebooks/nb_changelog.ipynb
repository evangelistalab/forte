    "## Version 0.4.0\n",
    "This is a major update that introduces several significant changes to the way Forte runs computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enables the Standard Workflow described in the Forte paper\n",
    "- Deprecate old CASSCF code\n",
    "- Renamed all `CASSCF_*` options to `MCSCF_*`. This will require tweaking old input files.\n",
    "- By default, Forte's standard workflow will run an MCSCF computation using the `ACTIVE_SPACE_SOLVER` provided in the input. This can be avoided by setting `MCSCF_REFERENCE` to `False`.\n",
    "- By default, the MCSCF code will combine the `FROZEN_DOCC` with the `RESTRICTED_DOCC` orbitals and optimize them. The user can control this with the keyword `MCSCF_FREEZE_CORE` (set by default to `False`).\n",
    "- After an MCSCF computation, `MCSCF_FREEZE_CORE = FALSE` will mix all inactive orbitals (frozen + restricted doubly occupied) in the semicanonicalization, while `MCSCF_FREEZE_CORE = FALSE` will semicanonicalize them separately.\n",
    "- Fixed printing of NOs which contained a bug (printed wrong orbital index) "
